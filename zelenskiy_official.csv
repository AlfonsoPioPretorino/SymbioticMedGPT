Ukraine has shown extraordinary bravery We did not surrender to Russia We have stopped and are gradually pushing the army of invaders, which was recently considered the second strongest in the world, out of our territory Nobody expected Ukrainians to have courage of this magnitude But this magnitude is there And this is the quality of our character - willingness to fight for freedom and for our values
